**Hello there!** 👋

My name is Dmytro Deordiiev, and I am a trainee frontend developer. I’m passionate about building engaging user interfaces and applications that deliver value to users. For me, development is like an adult version of LEGO — it’s fascinating that I can build anything I imagine by simply typing on a keyboard.

I am always striving to learn new things and improve my skills. I love to work in a team and to learn from others, and look forward to joining one where I can be a part of something bigger and meaningful.
